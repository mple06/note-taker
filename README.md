## Usage
# TEAM PROFILE GENERATOR

## Description

I built a backend team profile generator application for adding all of your employees to your company whether you have 10 or 100. The application will prompt by asking the manager to enter his or her info such has name, ID#, email and office number. The manager is then given the option to add an engineer, an intern, or build their team.

- Adding an engineer
  - displays name, ID, email, and GitHub username
- Adding an intern
  - displays name, ID, email, and school
- Build team
  - will generate an HTML to display all the team members inputted

 My main motivation for building this is to help small companies keep track of their employees and their information.
